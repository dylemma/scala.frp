/** An EventStream represents a (potentially finite) series of events that may occur at
  * any time in the future. EventStreams are stylistic replacements for Publishers
  * (from the Publisher/Subscriber, or Observer pattern). Events are produced as [[Event]]
  * instances - either a [[Fire]] or [[Stop]]. Each `Fire` event produced by an EventStream
  * represents a single "data". The `Stop` event represents the end of the stream.
  * Once an EventStream produces a `Stop` event, it is considered finished and will produce no more events.
  *
  * There are several ways to attach event handlers to an EventStream. The most low-level
  * way is to use the `sink` method, which operates on `Event` instances. The `foreach`
  * method is used to attach a handler that operates only on data from `Fire` events.
  * `onNext` and `onEnd` attach handlers to the next `Fire` and a `Stop`, respectively.
  * Attaching event handlers requires an implicit [[Observer]], which is used to manage
  * references between the handler and the stream.
  *
  * EventStreams can be transformed and combined in a variety of ways like filtering,
  * mapping, and concatenation.
  *
  * Below is a working example of EventStream usage.
  *
  * {{{
  * class Example extends App with Observer {
  * 	// Create an EventStream instance. EventSource is a subtype of
  * 	// EventStream, with the addition of `fire` and `stop` methods.
  * 	val stream = EventSource[Int]
  *
  * 	// Create a mapped version of the EventStream
  * 	val mappedStream = stream.map(_ * 2)
  *
  * 	// Attach an event handler, using the `foreach` syntax
  * 	for(i <- stream) println("Int event: " + i)
  * 	for(i <- mappedStream) println("Mapped event: " + i)
  *
  * 	// Attach an "end" event handler
  * 	stream onEnd { println("Got the end") }
  *
  * 	// fire some events
  * 	stream fire 1
  * 	// (prints "Int event: 1")
  * 	// (prints "Mapped event: 2")
  *
  * 	stream fire 5
  * 	// (prints "Int event: 5")
  * 	// (prints "Mapped event: 10")
  *
  * 	// stop the stream
  * 	stream.stop
  * 	// (prints "Got the end")
