/** An EventJoin is a transformer that takes in events of type `A`

  * {{{
  * protected def leftParent: EventStream[A]
  * protected def rightParent: EventStream[B]
  * protected def handle(event: Either[Event[A], Event[B]]): Boolean
  * }}}
  * Generally, `handle` will call `fire` and/or `stop`.
  * **Note:** to see the method signatures in this documentation, make
